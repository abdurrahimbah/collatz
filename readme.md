Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim. In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.

This project includes two function programs (collatz.py and nth_prime.p and one main program (main.py). As the names suggest, the collatz.py includes the the function collatz that takes an integer and returns the Collatz Conjecture as a list, te nth_prime.py includes the function nth_prime that takes an integer n and returns the nth integer. What we did at main.py is combining the two functions, it takes an integer n, uses the nth_prime function to obtain nth prime nunber, and returns the Collatz Conjecture as a list using the collatz function. 

This is Abdur Rahim. As-salamu alaikum wa rahmatullah.
